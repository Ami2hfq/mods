Both exe and manifest files,<br/>
<code>PaintDotNet.exe</code> can ran as any user but the rest must run as admin.<br/>
when download make sure to copy the exe to your Paint.Net folder, overwrite existing ones.<br/>
unblock all of the exes.
mark all of the exe to run as admins (<code>PaintDotNet.exe</code> is optional).
